* 	2 - Create a new tool record using the 'New' button
* 	3 - Fill the information about the new tool, name, label, scope, custom labels, etc. you can see samples in existing tools.
* 		The name of the tool must start with 'tool_' and can not contain spaces, accents or non ASCII chars to prevent future errors with paths, etc.
* 		A good name could be 'tool_numisdata_import' where 'tool_' is the mandatory prefix, 'numisdata' is the TLD from creator and 'import' is the main description of the tool.
* 		In the label, you could be more explicit like 'Tool to import Numismatic custom files'
